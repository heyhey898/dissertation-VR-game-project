# dissertation-VR-game-project
A VR shooting game developed using Unity 3d for the Quest 2. This VR game is used for the experimental process of a Master's dissertation researching the UX of VR locomotion techniques.

## Description of the game:
Players are required to shoot at waves of flying targets and to collect the object dropped after the target was destroyed. The dropped object will de-spawn if not collected for more than 6 seconds. The goal of the game is to shoot as many targets as possible and collect as many coins as possible within a time frame.
Players will be provided a laser gun for each hand. To move around, players could only use the locomotion technique chosen at the main menu. The provided techniques are: joystick, teleportation, and arm-swinging.
